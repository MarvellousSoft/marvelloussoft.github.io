		<h2>Hi!</h3>

			Marvellous Games creates the most beautiful, thought provoking, excruciatingly philosophical, questionably
			sane games that you will ever play, love and cherish forever in that special and troubled place called the
			heart.

			<h3>We aim to be the best.</h3>
			Not just the best at game development, but also the best at creating unforgettable memories.

			<h3>We aim to be supportive.</h3>
			We listen to our fans. Game content and ideas are always welcome here. Thought of the perfect Apple Juice
			Maker Simulator? We'll support your idea and start on creating that delicious fruit that we all love.

			<h3>We aim to be creative.</h3>
			Our clockworking minds are always oozing the fluids of love and ideas. But be sure that your fluids are also
			welcome in our games! We respect your input.<br><br><br>

			Want to know more about us? Tell us how handsome we are? How every game of ours made you feel the feels
			inside? How marvellously happy you are that we are doing what we're doing? How insane we look and act? How
			much you love us and that you want to have our babies?<br>
			<br>
			Then contact us at <strong>marvellous.amoeba@gmail.com</strong>!
