						<h2>Renato <em>"Totoro"</em> Lui Geh</h2>
						
						<em>Beautiful and majestic</em>. <em>Misterious yet mystifying</em>. <em>Enthralling and profoundly captivating</em>.<br>
						Those are a few words that a wise man once used to describe the magical scene that is Renato programming. A master of Java, Haxe and Visual Basic, a lover of the finest tea and arts, a companion of excellence in bridge, a friend of all living things. Those who are lucky to be embraced by his tenderness and kindness know that, even in the darkest hours, Totoro will always face life with a smile in his face and a rose in his hand. He can create the most beautiful site while composing sweet melodies with his trusted violin. Give him a two-hour cd of 80's music and he will make the most astonishing game you'll ever play.<br><br>

						More than a friend, his is an example for us all. Totoro, he will never give you up.

						<h2>Ricardo <em>"Rica"</em> Lira da Fonseca</h2>

						Beethoven, Delacroix, Lord Byron, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Ricardo Fonseca.<br> 
						What do all of these geniuses have in common? The vision to turn the ordinary into the most astonishingly beautiful piece of art.Just like Da Vinci, this strapping young man crosses the dimensions of art. With his cyan-colored eyes on a canvas and his fingers tightly strapped to a pencil he creates the most spectacular chef-d'oeuvre. And with his most accurate ears he can turn the most chaotic of sounds into a true melody.<br><br>

						This true maestro is envied by many. Admired by all.

						<h2>Yan <em>"Yan"</em> Soares Couto</h2>

						<strong>Peculiar</strong>.<br>
						This is the perfect word to describe such a genius of mathematics and coding.<br>
						A true stereotype of the mad genius, this highly troubled mind is constantly fighting its primitive urges of world domination. But instead of formulating an evil, ingenius plan to enslave humanity, Yan focuses all his energy into creating not only innovative, thought-provoking games, but also the most gruesome, poorly documented yet incredibly brilliant and efficient algorithms. Unstoppable, his only weakness is his heart. His friendly, forgiving and loveable character is what prevents him from becoming a mad scientist willing to sacrifice all humanity in exchange for a glass of ice cold Cotuba.<br><br>

						Science has yet to study his mind. But for now, <em>let his mind study science</em>.
